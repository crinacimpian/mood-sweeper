The MoodSweeper is a twist of the MineSweeper. The bombs are replaced with moods.

Click one of the cloud tiles.
These are non mood tiles. Each scores 1 point.
The mood corresponds to 5 elements...
The non mood tile triggers the fire element in you. So the Fire element increases.
Ideally the elements should be balanaced.

When you click on a mood tile, choose a positive or a negative mood.
See to which element the mood corresponds.

I'll choose a negative mood.
It reduces the mood score by 10 points.

Let's click on another mood tile and choose a positive mood.
Take a moment to be in the positive mood. Follow the instructions from here.
The mode score will increase by 10 points.

So, that's it.

The rules are here, in the Description.

Now it's the moment to enjoy the Experience!
What's your mood and how are your elements balanced?
